# Dynamic DNS

If you have no static IPv4 address (IPv6 should be configurable to be static), there's a need for Dynamic DNS.

There is [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org) but I use my router's dynamic DNS solution.

**Dynamic DNS doesn't seem to work with CapRover due to their structure when configuring HTTPS**
